# ChainCore - The Ultimate Blockchain Game Infrastructure

ChainCore is a powerful, modular blockchain infrastructure designed for game developers. It provides the essential building blocks for creating Web3 games while remaining completely engine-agnostic. Whether you're building with Unity, Unreal, Godot, Phaser.js, or any other game engine, ChainCore seamlessly integrates blockchain functionality into your game.

## Why ChainCore?

- **Engine Agnostic**: Works with any game engine or front-end framework
- **Game Design Agnostic**: Supports any game style, genre, or design pattern
- **Modular Architecture**: Use only what you need, upgrade when you want
- **Gas Optimized**: Built for efficiency and cost-effectiveness
- **Security First**: Enterprise-grade security with battle-tested patterns
- **Developer Friendly**: Clear interfaces and comprehensive documentation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 16.x
- npm >= 8.x
- Solidity ^0.8.20
- Hardhat
- OpenZeppelin Contracts

### Installation
```bash
npm install @chaincore/sdk
```

### Basic Setup
```javascript
import { ChainCore } from '@chaincore/sdk';

const chainCore = new ChainCore({
