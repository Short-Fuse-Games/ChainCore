### Smart Contract Structure
```solidity
// Core Contracts
contract ChainCore {
    // State variables
    State private currentState;
    IAssetManager public assetManager;
    IStateManager public stateManager;
    IEventManager public eventManager;
    
    // Core functions
    function initialize() external;
    function getState() external view returns (State);
    function updateState(State newState) external;
    function emitEvent(string memory eventName, bytes memory data) external;
}

// State Management
contract StateManager {
    // State variables
    State private currentState;
    uint256 private stateVersion;
    mapping(uint256 => State) private stateHistory;
    
    // State functions
    function getState() external view returns (State);
    function updateState(State newState) external;
    function getStateVersion() external view returns (uint256);
    function rollbackState(uint256 version) external;
}

// Asset Management
contract AssetManager {
    // State variables
    mapping(uint256 => Asset) private assets;
    mapping(address => uint256[]) private playerAssets;
    
    // Asset functions
    function getAsset(uint256 assetId) external view returns (Asset);
    function transferAsset(uint256 assetId, address to) external;
    function batchTransfer(uint256[] memory assetIds, address[] memory recipients) external;
    function getPlayerAssets(address player) external view returns (uint256[] memory);
}
```
