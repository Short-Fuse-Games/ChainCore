# ChainCore Technical Documentation

## Overview
ChainCore is a modular blockchain infrastructure designed for game developers. This document provides technical details about the system's architecture, components, and implementation.

## Core Components

### State Management System
The state management system is responsible for handling all on-chain game state. It provides:
- Efficient state storage and updates
- State synchronization between on-chain and off-chain
- Version control and rollback capabilities
- Event emission for state changes

### Asset Management
The asset management system handles all blockchain-based assets:
- NFT integration and management
- Asset ownership tracking
- Transfer mechanisms
- Metadata handling
- Support for both fungible and non-fungible tokens

### Transaction System
The transaction system manages all blockchain interactions:
- Batch transaction processing
- Transaction queuing
- Gas optimization
- Transaction validation
- Cross-chain support (future)

### Event System
The event system provides standardized event handling:
- Event emission standards
- Event filtering and querying
- Cross-contract event handling
- Event versioning

### Authentication & Authorization
The authentication system manages player identity and permissions:
- Player identity management
- Role-based access control
- Permission management
- Multi-signature support
